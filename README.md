# CodeMirrorBinding

This library lets you have a code editor with real-time collaborative editing, powered by [ShareDB](https://github.com/share/sharedb) and [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net).

To see it in action, try out the test project under `/test`, or edit a visualization in [datavis.tech](https://datavis.tech).
